# if __name__ == '__main__': IN PYTHON
'''
'__name__' evaluates to the name of the module in python from where the program is ran.
If the module is being run directly from the command line, the '__name__' is set to the string "__main__".
Thus this behaviour is used to check whether the module is run directly or imported to another file.
