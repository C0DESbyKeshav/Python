# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set s = {8, 7, 12, "Keshav", [1,2]}

# Lists and sets both are MUTABLE.
# Sets are unindexed so, it is not possible to access any particular element of the set and change it.
# * CONCLUSION: The values inside a list which is contained in set s can't be changed.
